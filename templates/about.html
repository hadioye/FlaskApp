            <h2>About the Project:</h2>
            This website is a university project created for my university's second semester. 
            It is a fully functional e-commerce website built using Python Flask as the web framework. The project 
            demonstrates various functionalities like user authentication, product browsing, shopping cart, and 
            order processing.
            
            <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
            The website utilizes a combination of technologies to deliver a seamless user experience. Python Flask 
            is the core web framework that powers the server-side logic. For data storage, we use a PostgreSQL 
            database managed by Python's SQLAlchemy library. The dynamic rendering of web pages is achieved with 
            the help of HTML, CSS, and Jinja2 templating engine.

            <h2>Database Schema:</h2>
            The database schema is designed to efficiently store and manage product details, user information, and 
            order data. The tables are normalized to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy. The schema includes 
            tables for products, users, orders, and order items, with appropriate relationships between them.

            <h2>Routing and Navigation:</h2>
            The website uses Flask's routing capabilities to handle HTTP requests and map them to specific functions 
            in the routes.py file. This ensures seamless navigation between different pages, such as the Home, Shop, 
            About, and Contact pages.

            <h2>Project Author:</h2>
            I am the student behind this project, and it has been a challenging and rewarding experience to work on 
            this e-commerce website. If you have any questions or inquiries, please don't hesitate to contact me 
            through the Contact page.

            Thank you for visiting our website!
